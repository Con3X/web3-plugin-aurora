web3.js plugin for Aurora NEAR engine
===========

This is an npm package containing a web3.js plugin for Aurora NEAR engine.

Plugin usage by users
------------
At your typescript project first run:
`yarn add web3 @conx3/web3-plugin-aurora`

And here is how to use the plugin:
```ts
import { Web3 } from 'web3';
import { AuroraPlugin } from '@conx3/web3-plugin-aurora';

async function aurora() {
  const web3 = new Web3('https://mainnet.aurora.dev');
  web3.registerPlugin(new AuroraPlugin(web3.provider));

  const blockNumber = await web3.aurora.getBlockNumber();
  console.log('aurora blockNumber', blockNumber);

  const parityPendingTransactions =
    await web3.aurora.parityPendingTransactions();
  console.log('aurora parityPendingTransactions', parityPendingTransactions);
}

aurora();
```

### NEAR Aurora Plugin

Aurora is an EVM-compatible blockchain built as a smart contract atop NEAR blockchain. This plugin would leverage Aurora custom RPC methods (https://doc.aurora.dev/evm/rpc/) and other custom behavior enabled at Aurora especially Cross-Contract Calls (XCC). More on Aurora XCC at https://github.com/aurora-is-near/aurora-contracts-sdk.

![](https://us-central1-progress-markdown.cloudfunctions.net/progress/100?dangerColor=ccee00&warningColor=eeff00&successColor=006600) Create NEAR Aurora Plugin and publish it to the `npm` registry

The web3.js plugin for NEAR Aurora has been publish to  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@conx3/web3-plugin-aurora and it is useable inside this example playground: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/misty-leftpad-v7249s?file=%2Findex.js. Additionally, some tests has been written to test some of the basic functionality. 

![](https://us-central1-progress-markdown.cloudfunctions.net/progress/50?dangerColor=ccee00&warningColor=eeff00&successColor=006600) `web3.aurora` is also accessible as `web3.near.aurora`

Aurora plugin could be used now as `web3.near.aurora`.
However, its registration needs a bit of simplification. A PR would be opened later on web3.js registry for this and similar use cases.


![](https://us-central1-progress-markdown.cloudfunctions.net/progress/90?dangerColor=ccee00&warningColor=eeff00&successColor=006600) Enable all Ethereum RPC methods on `AuroraPlugin`

Now all Ethereum RPC methods are callable on `web3.aurora` (and on `web3.near.aurora` as a consequence). However, there is a small modification needed to not expose the unsupported methods on `web3.aurora` and the `AuroraPlugin` class.


![](https://us-central1-progress-markdown.cloudfunctions.net/progress/10?dangerColor=ccee00&warningColor=eeff00&successColor=006600) Support custom RPC methods on `AuroraPlugin` (the non-basic-Ethereum)

Some of the custom RPC endpoints available at Aurora Engine are now callable on `AuroraPlugin` as an example of this functionality. However, some of them seems to not be yet implemented in the current version running the main net and test net. Even though, they is marked as completed at:  https://doc.aurora.dev/evm/rpc. So, this need to be double checked.
    

### NEAR Plugin

There is a web3.js plugin for the NEAR protocol. Check its repository at: https://github.com/conx3/web3-plugin-near

### Testing AuroraPlugin

Executing `yarn test aurora.test.ts` would give something like:
```bash

 PASS  test/aurora.test.ts
